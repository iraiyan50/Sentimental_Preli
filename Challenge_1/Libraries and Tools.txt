Libraries and Tools
Datasets (datasets):

Used for loading and preprocessing datasets.
The specific dataset being used is "SKNahin/bengali-transliteration-data", indicating a Bengali transliteration/translation task.
Transformers (transformers):

A library by Hugging Face for natural language processing.
Tools used:
AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM: Loads a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model.
AutoTokenizer: Handles tokenization, preparing text for model input.
The notebook uses the mT5-small model, a multilingual transformer model from Google, fine-tuned for translation tasks.
Torch (torch):

A machine learning framework commonly used for deep learning.
Likely used for model training and evaluation.
Python Utilities:

Preprocessing functions and data manipulations, such as splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
